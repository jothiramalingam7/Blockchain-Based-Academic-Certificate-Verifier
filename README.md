 Project Name: CertChain
Blockchain-Powered Academic Certificate Verifier


Introduction
Purpose:
CertChain is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to issue, store, and verify academic certificates securely on the blockchain.

Why?
Academic fraud is a growing issue globally. Certificates can be forged easily, and verification processes are slow, manual, and error-prone. Our system solves this using blockchain technology.

Problem Statement
Paper certificates can be lost, stolen, or tampered with.

Existing verification methods are manual and non-transparent.

Employers face difficulties in verifying credentials from international institutions.

Our Solution: CertChain
A blockchain-powered platform that:

Allows universities to issue certificates securely.

Lets employers and institutions verify them instantly.

Uses cryptographic hashing and smart contracts for tamper-proof verification.

Key Features
Feature	Description
Admin Portal	University admin can issue certificates via dashboard.
Public Verification Portal	Anyone can verify a certificate by uploading it or entering its ID.
Blockchain Storage	Certificate hash is permanently stored on the blockchain.
Blockchain Explorer	View transaction history and metadata of each certificate.
Secure & Decentralized	Data integrity without centralized control.

Technology Stack
Backend:

Java (Spring Boot) – RESTful API & business logic

PostgreSQL – Store user & admin data (not certificates)

web3j – Ethereum interaction from Java

Blockchain:

Ethereum (local via Ganache, or testnet)

Solidity – Smart contracts for certificate logic

Frontend:

React.js – Admin portal & public verification portal

MetaMask – Wallet connection for issuing certificates

Smart Contract Overview
Certificate Registry

Stores: studentName, course, institution, hash, timestamp

Functions:

issueCertificate() → stores cert hash

verifyCertificate() → compares input hash

Solidity Snippet:

solidity
Copy
Edit
function verifyCertificate(string memory id, string memory hash) public view returns (bool) {
    return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(certificates[id].hash)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked(hash));
}
Demo Flow
Admin Use Case:

Login to admin portal.

Fill student details & upload PDF.

Hash is generated and stored on blockchain.

Public Use Case:

Upload certificate or enter ID.

System hashes the document.

Compares with blockchain hash.

Displays  Valid / Invalid.

Security Considerations
Only hash of the certificate is stored on-chain (not raw PDF).

Admin login secured with JWT.

Smart contract ensures immutability.

Verification is public, transparent, and trustless.

Innovations & Benefits
Innovation	Impact
Blockchain-based storage	Certificates can’t be faked.
File hash verification	Instant authenticity check.
Open verification system	Accessible to anyone globally.
Privacy-by-design	Only hashes are public, no PII leaked.

Future Enhancements
Issue certificates as NFTs (non-transferable tokens).

Build a mobile app for real-time QR scan verification.

Consortium of universities using Hyperledger Fabric.

Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs for private cert validation.
